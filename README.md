# Project Title
Heart Attack Prediction App

# Project Description
According to World Health Organisation (WHO), every year around 17.9 million deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) predisposing CVD becoming the leading cause of death globally. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, if left untreated it may cause heart attack. Heart attack occurs due to the presence of obstruction of blood flow into the heart. The presence of blockage may be due to the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other substances. Despite treatment has improved over the years and most CVD’s pathophysiology have been elucidated, heart attack can still be fatal.

# Data Description
Thus, clinicians believe that prevention of heart attack is always better than curing it. After many years of research, scientists and clinicians discovered that, the probability of one’s getting heart attack can be determined by analysing the patient’s age, gender, exercise induced angina, number of major vessels, chest pain indication, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, and maximum heart rate achieved.

Test case
So once your app is developed, the clinicians decided to test the app you developed. 
The table below contains the patient’s condition. Key in the data into your model to see if your model able make prediction same as the true output.
Then compute the accuracy in percentage (%)

You can see how the heart dataset looks like!

# How to install and run the project
This project can be run via [Google Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0dhh7LAojDREjf9otVbAjLyhqvEdl2B?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)) with the help of GPU and without additional modules installation.

# How to use the project
You can access the full codes [Customer_Segmentation_train](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0dhh7LAojDREjf9otVbAjLyhqvEdl2B#scrollTo=9P6Avw2pNn0s) to testing it out.
There is also module that you can look into it! It can be used for tuning during eda, model development and model evaluation.

If you want to try it out yourself, makes sure you have the Train.csv uploaded! 

So let us see if you could achieve higher than my accuracy!
